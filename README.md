Here is the project description broken down into key points:

Real-Time Facial Recognition: Automates attendance using AI to detecting and verifying faces instantly.
Liveness Detection: Prevents spoofing by ensuring the user is present and "alive" (e.g., requires a smile to mark attendance).
GPS Geofencing: Restricts attendance marking to specific physical locations (like a campus) for Faculty and Administrators.
Smart Analytics: Visualizes attendance trends and statistics through interactive charts and graphs.
Automated Notifications: Sends instant email alerts for entry and exit times.
Secure Cloud Backend: Powered by Google Firebase for real-time database management and secure authentication.
Multi-Role Management: Dedicated support for Students, Faculty, and Administrators.
