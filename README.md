**Latest Deployment: Retrying with updated secrets...**

Here is the project description broken down into key points:

1. **Real-Time Facial Recognition**: Automates attendance using AI to detecting and verifying faces instantly.
2. **Liveness Detection**: Prevents spoofing by ensuring the user is present and "alive" (e.g., requires a smile to mark attendance).
3. **GPS Geofencing**: Restricts attendance marking to specific physical locations (like a campus) for Faculty and Administrators.
4. **Smart Analytics**: Visualizes attendance trends and statistics through interactive charts and graphs.
5. **Automated Notifications**: Sends instant email alerts for entry and exit times.
6. **Secure Cloud Backend**: Powered by Google Firebase for real-time database management and secure authentication.
7. **Multi-Role Management**: Dedicated support for Students, Faculty, and Administrators.
